##Entity Visualizer

This is a single page application to visualize Entity model created using EntityFramework 6. By getting $metadata about the service layer 
I use power of React and GoJS together to visualize them. 



## Try This

Download the project and update service URL in App.js. Update credentials for service layer in config.js file in component.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser.
